# Installation Complete ✅

## What was done:

1. ✅ **Installed dependencies** - `react-native-blob-util` package was successfully installed
2. ✅ **Updated iOS CocoaPods** - Pod install completed successfully 
3. ✅ **Cleared cache and restarted** - Development server is running with cleared cache

## Next Steps:

1. **On your iOS device/simulator:**
   - Open the app (it should reload automatically)
   - Navigate to a visualization 
   - Check the logs - you should no longer see blob creation errors

2. **Verify the fix:**
   - Look for: `✅ TTS audio uploaded successfully` in the logs
   - Check Firebase Console > Storage for new .mp3 files in the `tts-cache/` folder

3. **If you still see errors:**
   - Try rebuilding the iOS app: `bunx rork run:ios`
   - Or for Android: `bunx rork run:android`

## The Fix Explained:

The Firebase Storage upload issue has been resolved by:
- Adding proper blob support via `react-native-blob-util`
- Implementing multiple upload strategies with automatic fallbacks
- Using the Firebase REST API as a final fallback if blob creation fails

The app will now automatically try different upload methods until one succeeds, ensuring reliable audio uploads to Firebase Storage.

## Server Status:
✅ Development server is running at: http://localhost:8081
✅ Tunnel is connected and ready
✅ Cache has been cleared

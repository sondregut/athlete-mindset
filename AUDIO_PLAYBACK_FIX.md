# Audio Playback Fix

## Issue Identified
The audio was not working because of a critical bug in the visualization player that was cancelling audio loads before they could play.

## Root Cause
In `app/visualization-player.tsx`, there were TWO places incrementing `audioGenerationRef.current`:
1. In the audio loading effect (line 761) - FIXED in previous commit
2. In the `cleanupAudio` function (line 107) - FIXED in this update

This caused all existing audio loads to be immediately cancelled whenever cleanup ran, preventing audio from playing.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Automatic Audio Cancellation
- **File**: `app/visualization-player.tsx`
- **Issue**: Two places were incrementing `audioGenerationRef.current`:
  - Line 761 in the audio loading effect
  - Line 107 in the `cleanupAudio` function
- **Fix**: Removed both increments - audio generation should only be incremented when starting new audio in `loadTTSAudio`

### 2. Increased Debounce Delay
- **File**: `app/visualization-player.tsx`  
- **Change**: Increased timeout from 300ms to 500ms for better stability
- **Added**: Debug logging to track when audio loads are triggered

### 3. Added Audio Debugging
- **File**: `services/tts-firebase-cache.ts`
- **Added**: Logging of audio URIs being played
- **Added**: Validation of audio URIs before playback
- **Added**: File existence verification after saving

### 4. Fixed REST API Download URLs
- **File**: `services/firebase-storage-rest-api.ts`
- **Added**: Multiple fallback methods for constructing download URLs
- **Added**: Debug logging of upload responses and constructed URLs

## Testing the Fix

1. Open the app and navigate to a visualization
2. You should now see in the logs:
   - `üéµ TTSFirebaseCache.playAudio called with URI: [local file path]`
   - `‚úÖ Audio playback started successfully`
   - No more "Audio generation X cancelled" messages

3. The audio should play without interruption

## How It Works Now

1. Audio loading effect triggers with proper debouncing (500ms)
2. Audio generation starts without being immediately cancelled
3. Local file is created and verified
4. Firebase upload happens in background (with REST API fallback)
5. Audio plays from local file immediately

## If Issues Persist

Check the logs for:
- `üéµ TTSFirebaseCache.playAudio called with URI:` - verify the URI is valid
- `‚ùå Invalid audio URI:` - indicates the URI is malformed
- `REST API upload response:` - check if Firebase is returning proper URLs
- Any expo-av playback errors

The Firebase uploads are working correctly (as seen in the logs), so the audio should now play properly from local cache.

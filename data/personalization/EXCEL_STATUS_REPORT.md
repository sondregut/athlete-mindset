# Excel Visualization System Status Report

## Current Status ✅

The Excel-based visualization personalization system is **fully functional** and working as designed.

### System Components Working:
1. **Excel Parser** - Successfully parsing Excel files to JSON
2. **Personalization Service** - Loading and serving content correctly
3. **Fallback Mechanism** - Working perfectly when sport-specific content unavailable
4. **Integration** - Properly integrated with the app's visualization player

## Current Data Status

### Visualizations with Templates Only (14 files):
- batman-effect
- unstoppable-confidence  
- productivity-focus
- integrated-skill
- top-1-percent
- peak-performance-sports
- breath-awareness
- goal-visualization
- sports-fitness
- letting-go
- rehearsing-day
- releasing-anxiety
- hope-resilience
- building-self-belief

### Visualizations with Sport-Specific Content (1 file):
- **sample-filled** - Contains examples for:
  - pole_vault
  - horizontal_jumps
  - high_jump
  - distance_running
  - sprinting
  - throws

## How the System Works Now

When an athlete selects a sport (e.g., Track & Field - Pole Vault):

1. The system looks for `pole_vault` column in the visualization's Excel file
2. If found → Uses the personalized content
3. If not found → Uses the template content (current behavior for 14/15 visualizations)
4. Audio is generated from whichever content is selected

**This is working correctly!** All athletes see template content because that's what's in the Excel files.

## Sport Name Mapping

The system maps user selections to Excel column names:

### Track & Field Events:
| User Selection | Excel Column Name |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Pole Vault | pole_vault |
| High Jump | high_jump |
| Long Jump | horizontal_jumps |
| Triple Jump | horizontal_jumps |
| Sprints (100m/200m/400m) | sprinting |
| Middle Distance (800m/1500m) | distance_running |
| Long Distance (5000m/10000m) | distance_running |
| Shot Put | throws |
| Discus | throws |
| Javelin | throws |
| Hammer | throws |

### Other Sports:
| User Selection | Excel Column Name |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Basketball | basketball |
| Swimming | swimming |
| Soccer | soccer |
| Tennis | tennis |
| Golf | golf |
| Weightlifting | weightlifting |
| Yoga | yoga |
| Dance | dance |

## Instructions for Adding Sport-Specific Content

### 1. Edit Excel Files
Open any visualization Excel file (e.g., `peak-performance-sports.xlsx`) and:
- Keep the `Step_ID` and `Template_Text` columns
- Add columns for sports (use exact column names from mapping above)
- Fill in personalized content following these rules:
  - Keep 80-90% of template unchanged
  - Replace generic terms (track/gym/field) with sport-specific venues
  - Maintain same timing and structure
  - Don't add/remove content

### 2. Re-parse to JSON
After editing Excel files:
```bash
bun run utils/excel-parser.ts ./data/personalization/excel
```

### 3. Verify Updates
The app will automatically use the new content. No code changes needed!

## Example of Proper Personalization

**Template:**
> "Start by mentally immersing yourself in the environment where you'll perform. Imagine every detail - whether it's the track, gym, field, court, or road."

**Personalized for Pole Vault:**
> "Start by mentally immersing yourself in the environment where you'll perform. Imagine every detail - the runway, the pit, the standards holding the bar."

**Personalized for Swimming:**
> "Start by mentally immersing yourself in the environment where you'll perform. Imagine every detail - the pool, the lane lines, the starting blocks."

## Testing After Updates

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
bun run scripts/test-visualization-system.ts
```

This will show:
- Which visualizations have sport-specific content
- Whether personalizations are being found
- Fallback behavior for missing content

## Summary

✅ **System Status**: Fully operational
✅ **Current Behavior**: Shows templates (as expected)
✅ **Ready for Content**: Just add to Excel files and re-parse
✅ **No Code Changes Needed**: System will automatically use new content

The system is working exactly as designed. Once Excel files are populated with sport-specific content, athletes will automatically receive personalized visualizations based on their sport selection.
